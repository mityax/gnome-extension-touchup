  Enhances various aspects of the GNOME experience when using a touch device.

  Current features:
    - Navigation bar (gestures and buttons mode), as known from Android
    - Touch gestures for notifications (dismiss, collapse, expand)
    - Make the notification area touch-scrollable
    - Onscreen Keyboard: key popups, extended keys, swipe to close.
    - Floating rotate button when auto-rotation is off, as known from Android
    - Overview and desktop background gestures (switch workspaces, open/close overview)
    - Overview window preview gestures (swipe up to close windows, hold+move to drag)

  A lot more is planned, have a look at the roadmap for that: https://github.com/mityax/gnome-extension-touchup
